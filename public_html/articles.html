            <h3>The Big Home Run Hitter!</h3>
            <p>On Sunday afternoon, history was made when rookie pitcher, Mike the Tike, who hit 3 home runs during his 4 at bats in the game on Sunday. The GM (General Manager) of the Bluebirds was even surprised at this outcome. Nobody has ever seen this kid swing like this before and it was amazing. The next game for the Bluebirds is this Tuesday vs. the Raptors and is a sell-out crowd. Everyone is hoping to witness even more history at the next upcoming game...</p>

            <p>In the opening game of the preseason opener, the Blackhawks scored a total of 135 points against the reigning champions on Sunday afternoon. This is the most a team has scored on the reigning NBA champs for almost three whole decades. With the young offensive talent that the Blackhawks have, they may be trouble for a lot of defenses in the NBA come this season.
