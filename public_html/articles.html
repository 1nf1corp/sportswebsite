          <p class="blog-post-meta">by <a href="#">Billy Bob</a>
          <p>On Sunday afternoon, history was made when rookie pitcher, Mike the Tike, who hit 3 home runs during his 4 at bats in the game on Sunday. The GM (General Manager) of the Bluebirds was even surprised at this outcome. Nobody has ever seen this kid swing like this before and it was amazing. The next game for the Bluebirds is this Tuesday vs. the Raptors and is a sell-out crowd. Everyone is hoping to witness even more history at the next upcoming game...</p>

With no other place to call home, he lived in an orphanage on the west side of Seattle for almost his whole child life, until a nice couple had adopted him at the age of 16. Last Monday marked the day when this young star was adopted, and to celebrate this he donated over $35,000 to the orphanage of which he came from. He felt like it was his obligation to give those kids more so they felt like they had a chance of leaving one day and finding a home like he did...</p>
